The SFI R package provides tools to compute the Signal Fidelity Index
(SFI), which quantifies diagnostic data quality at the patient level. It
enables simulation of clinical data, calculation of SFI components, and
evaluation of SFI-aware calibration methods to improve model performance
across heterogeneous datasets without requiring outcome labels in target
domains.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sfi like so:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")  # if not already installed
devtools::install_github("clai-group/sfi")
```
