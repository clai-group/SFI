The SFI R package provides tools to compute the Signal Fidelity Index (SFI), which quantifies diagnostic data quality at the patient level. It enables simulation of clinical data, calculation of SFI components, and evaluation of SFI-aware calibration methods to improve model performance across heterogeneous datasets without requiring outcome labels in target domains.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sfi like so:


```{r}
install.packages("devtools")  # if not already installed
devtools::install_github("clai-group/sfi")
```
