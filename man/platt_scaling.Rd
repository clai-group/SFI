\title{Apply Platt Scaling (Logistic Calibration) - Robust Version}
\usage{
platt_scaling(train_probs, train_labels, test_probs)
}
\arguments{
\item{train_probs}{Numeric vector of training predicted probabilities.}

\item{train_labels}{Numeric (0/1) vector of training labels.}

\item{test_probs}{Numeric vector of test predicted probabilities.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of calibrated probabilities.
}
\description{
Fits a logistic calibration model on training probabilities and returns
calibrated probabilities for the test set with full edge-case handling.
