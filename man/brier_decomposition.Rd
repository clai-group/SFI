\title{Compute Brier Score Decomposition}
\usage{
brier_decomposition(labels, predictions, n_bins = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{labels}{Binary outcome vector (0/1)}

\item{predictions}{Predicted probabilities (0-1)}

\item{n_bins}{Number of bins for grouping predictions (default = 10)}
}
\value{
List containing:
\itemize{
\item brier_score: Overall Brier score
\item reliability: Calibration component (lower is better)
\item resolution: Discrimination component (higher is better)
\item uncertainty: Inherent uncertainty in outcomes
}
}
\description{
Decomposes the Brier score into reliability (calibration),
resolution (discrimination), and uncertainty components.
